Here is my Module 14 Challenge: The Belly Button Challenge
#
In this assignment, I was tasked with building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
#
This challenge was pretty fun to complete and made me feel a lot more comfortable with the skills we learned in this Module. I was able to complete it by just going off of our solved class activities, as well as just some troubleshooting on my own. Overall I am very happy with how it turned out and I hope you are too. 
#
The code for the dashboard, and the index can be found in the "App" folder, and the data can be found in the "Resources" folder.

Thank you for taking the time to grade my assignment!
